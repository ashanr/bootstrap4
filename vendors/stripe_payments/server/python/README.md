# Stripe Payments Demo — Python Server

This demo uses a simple [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) application as the server.

## Payments Integration

* [`app.py`](app.py) contains the routes that interface with Stripe to create charges and receive webhook events.
* [`setup.py`](setup.py) a simple setup script to make some fake Products and SKUs for our Stripe store.
* [`tests/tests.py`](tests/tests.py) some unit tests that test the logic of our heavier APIs like `orders/<string:id>/pay` and `/webhook`.
* [`test_data.py`](tests/tests.py) contains some hardcoded mocked responses to test with.
* [`inventory_manager.py`](stripe_lib.py) a minimal wrapper over the Stripe Python SDK that handles creating/fetching orders and products. You can override this class with your own order management system code.

## Requirements

You’ll need the following:

* [Python 3.6.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-365/)
* Modern browser that supports ES6 (Chrome to see the Payment Request, and Safari to see Apple Pay).
* Stripe account to accept payments ([sign up](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) for free!)

## Getting Started

Before getting started, check to see that you have the right version of Python installed (3.6.5).

```
python3 --version
```

_If your machine is running Python 2 as the default then you can follow these great guides on installing Python 3 for [macOS](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/osx/), [Windows](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/win/), or [Linux](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/linux/)._

Once you have Homebrew and Python 3 set up, copy the example environment variables file `.env.example` from the root of the repo into your own environment file called `.env`:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Update your `.env` file with your own [Stripe API keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys) and any other configuration details you might want to add. The env variables are managed via the [python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv) package.

Create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) to manage the packages and state our application needs:

```
cd server/python
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Run `pip install` to fetch the Python packages we use:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Export our Flask app and run!

```
export FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run
```

You should now see it running on [`http://127.0.0.1:5000/`](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

### Testing Webhooks

If you want to test [receiving webhooks](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks), we recommend using ngrok to expose your local server.

First [download ngrok](https://ngrok.com) and start your Flask application.

[Run ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs). Assuming your Flask application is running on the default port 5000, you can simply run ngrok in your Terminal in the directory where you downloaded ngrok:

```
./ngrok http 5000
```

ngrok will display a UI in your terminal telling you the new forwarding address for your Flask app. Use this URL as the URL to be called in your developer [webhooks panel.](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks)

Don't forget to append `/webhook` when you set up your Stripe webhook URL in the Dashboard. Example URL to be called: `http://75795038.ngrok.io/webhook`.

## Tests

You can find tests for the API located in the `tests` directory. Make sure you're running in the virtual environment you created earlier.

```
souce env/bin/activate
cd tests
python tests.py
```
